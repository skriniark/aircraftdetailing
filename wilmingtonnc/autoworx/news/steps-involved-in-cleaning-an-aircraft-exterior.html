                      <h4>Prepare the Aircraft Exterior </h4><br><p>Preparing the aircraft exterior for cleaning involves a few steps. First, you have to gather all the necessary supplies such as soap, water and sponges. Then, (you) inspect the surface of the aircraft to find any cracks or dings that need repair before proceeding with cleaning. After repairing any defects, it's time to start washing! Start from the top and work your way down in sections, removing dirt and debris with a soft cloth. Be sure not to use harsh materials or chemicals - they can damage the surface of the plane! Once done, rinse off all soap residue thoroughly with clean water.<br />
Now it's time to dry off! Use a microfiber towel to buff away excess moisture and get rid of streaks. (And) be sure not to leave any wet patches on the plane - that could result in rusting over time! Furthermore, you should pay special attention when wiping out hard-to-reach areas like windowsills and undercarriage compartments. <br />
Finally, take a look at your work: if there are still any smudges left behind, use a clean polishing cloth and some polish for those extra tough spots. And don't forget to check every nook and cranny one last time before giving yourself an attaboy for completing this job successfully! <br />

(First,) You'll need scrub brushes, sponges, rags and buckets of warm soapy water. Don't forget to bring along some polishing cloths! You'll also require a few ladders or stepladders to reach those hard-to-get spots. And don't forget your safety gear: goggles, gloves and respirators. <br />
<br />
Moreover, you may want to have some specialized cleaning solutions on hand as well – depending on how much dirt there is and how difficult it is to remove.

Apply these solutions in small amounts directly onto the stain with a cloth or sponge - be careful not to spread them over too much area! Let it sit for at least two minutes before wipin' away with a wet rag. Again, remember to use protective gear when handlin' such substances! <br />
<br />
On top of that, if your aircraft's paint has been damaged or faded due to weather conditions like sun exposure or rain, there are special coatings available on the market which can be applied as an additional layer of protection.

Once done, rinse off the detergent with plain water and then dry off again with that same soft cloth. Finally, apply some wax for extra protection and shine! <br />
<br />

<br />
